It is a 2D infinite survival game.

While playing this game your job is to evade the monsters.
And by any chance, if you touch the monster then you died.

While playing the game the speed of monsters and spirits increases continuously. Because of this, you can't get the highest score easily.

But I'm a very kind person. So I added one feature to the game. that is the rate of the scoreboard increases. means your score speed increase depending on your survival time in-game. which helps the player reach the highest score.

So, let's see how much you get the score...
